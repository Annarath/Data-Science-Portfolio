This repository is my portfolio, storing Data Science Projects
<br />
<br />
I self-taught data science via online courses and projects for hands-on practices. I am a final year Industrial Economics undergraduate student who is interested in Data Science. I am aiming to pursue my further studies and careers in Data Science field. I may not be the best at programming and data science as I just started my Data science journey for about a year alongsides my university work, but I am confident that I am an ambitious person as "do everthing the best I can" is my personal all-time life quote.
<br />
<br />
Projects are in Python language and is in both VSCode and Jupyter Notebook format.
<br />
<br />
### Resort Improvement Project (Python)
<br />
[In Progress]
<br />
This is the project where I requested my family resort's historical data to do EDA on, to see how each revenue source such as room booking, demand for extra services (such as extra bed and room services), cancelations and etc. correlates together. The purpose of this project is to observe the behaviour of customers of the resort and grab the unseen opportunities that may rise up after data analysis.

### Fire Services in London (R)
<br />
This project is one of my assignments from the module Business Statistics from the course MSc Business Analytics (Warwick Business School). I incorporated Welch Two Sample t-test to assess whether there are difference between the two area's average incident values. This type of test is utilised because the two subject groups I want to test i.e. incidents happened in Ealing and incident happened in Greenwich is independent of each other. I got to practice my interpretation of results and report writing for non-technical stakeholders in which I believe are essential skills for future career as a Data Analyst.
<br />
<br />
### Optimisation Models (Python)
<br />
These selections of models are, also, part of my assignment for the module Optimisation Model from the course MSc Business Analytics (Warwick Business School). This is my very first try of creating optimisation model from scratch on Python (I only tried it on STATA). The aim for this assignment was to generate own model from from given problem scenarios in excel, then link the data to Python to continue building models. I would like to highlight on the "Sauces Production Problem" as I am very proud to successfully tackled it.
<br />
<br />
### House Price Prediction Project (Python)
<br />
This is my first ever complete data science priject. The data is from the open competition on Kaggle. The score is evaluated by root mean squared error, which I scored 0.16840. In this project I got to practice my EDA, Feature Engineering (includes cut and combine festures, work with missing datas, and practice Regression ML model. I got to use tools like MinMaxScaler from sklearn for data preprocessing, Sequential ANN model from tensorflow.keras and predict the house price for unknown houses with the model I created.
<br />
<br />
### Sony Merger Project (Python)
<br />
The project is EDA based. I look into each factors that this aquisition by Sony of AWAL and KNR affected and see if there are a problem with this anticpmpetitive act in the Music Industry UK. Moreover, I calculate the HHI and CRK to see analyse the market concentration. All the data are collected and scraped by me with the help of my group member (for the Industrial Economics III group coursework).
<br />
<br />
### Small EDA on Pizza Price Data (R)
<br />
The purpose of this project is to practice more of EDA and data preparation for use in the model (classification models). Data cleaning is performed as well as testing for information gain for a specific objective column.
