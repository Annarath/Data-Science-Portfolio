**This repository is my portfolio, storing Data Science Projects**
<br />
I self-taught data science via online courses and projects for hands-on practices. I am a final year Industrial Economics undergraduate student who is interested in Data Science. I am aiming to pursue my further studies and careers in Data Science field. I may not be the best at programming and data science as I just started my Data science journey for about a year alongsides my university work, but I am confident that I am an ambitious person as "do everthing the best I can" is my personal all-time life quote.
<br />
Projects are in Python language and is in both VSCode and Jupyter Notebook format.

**Resort Improvement Project**
<br />
[In Progress]
<br />
This is the project where I requested my family resort's historical data to do EDA on, to see how each revenue source such as room booking, demand for extra services (such as extra bed and room services), cancelations and etc. correlates together. The purpose of this project is to observe the behaviour of customers of the resort and grab the unseen opportunities that may rise up after data analysis.

**House Price Prediction Project**
<br />
This is my first ever complete data science priject. The data is from the open competition on Kaggle. The score is evaluated by root mean squared error, which I scored 0.16840. In this project I got to practice my EDA, Feature Engineering (includes cut and combine festures, work with missing datas, and practice Regression ML model. I got to use tools like MinMaxScaler from sklearn for data preprocessing, Sequential ANN model from tensorflow.keras and predict the house price for unknown houses with the model I created.
