This report is one of my assignments for the module Business Statistics at the Warwick Business School.

# Section 1

This report fulfills the requests from Fire service managers and local politicians, performing the specific analyses requested.

1. Provide a breakdown for the sum of all costs associated with responding to fires during the time period, and (separately) the sum of all costs associated with responding to false alarms. Also, the average (mean) cost of responding to a fire, and of responding to a false alarm.

2. Provide a visualisation showing response times to all incidents where there was indeed a response.

3. Provide summary statistics for response times in the special service incidences.

4. Perform a two sample t-test to see if there is a significant difference in the average response times for Ealing area compared to those in Greenwich.

5. Perform a Estimation approach and assess the confidence interval.

## Data Dictionary
This Data Dictionary includes only variables that are used in this analysis. This description is referred from the Fire service.

Variables                          | Description
-----------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------
IncidentGroup                      | High level description of the incident; Fire, Special Service or False Alarm
SpecialServiceType                 | Special Services are emergencies other than Fire that the LFB attend. Special Service Type categories these into 21 different services
IncGeo_BoroughName              | The Borough name in which the incident was geographically located
FirstPumpArriving_AttendanceTime   | The attendance time (in seconds) for the first fire engine to arrive after it has been mobilised from a fire station (or other location if it was mobile by Brigade Control at the time of the call). When fire crews arrive they record their attendance using an on-board computer (a Mobile Data Terminal). There will be occasions when the first crew to arrive fail to record this correctly (either as human error or a delay/ failure in the communications). When this happens the time recorded may in fact be the second or third.
Notional Cost (£)                  | An estimate of the cost of the incident response

## Data Structure and Summary

```{r Data Structure and Summary}
#Check Data Structure
str(fire_data)

#Check Data Summary
summary(fire_data)
```

## 1. Cost Responding to Fires and False Alarms

The sum and average of all costs associated with responding to fires and false alarms during the time period.

```{r}
sum(is.na(fire_data$`Notional Cost (£)`))

#There are only 2111 out of 322375 entries that contains NA for the Notional Costs variable. Hence, it would not effect the average value significantly if we omit NA. (Do not need to fill NA)
```

```{r Costs of responding}
summary_cost <- fire_data %>% 
    group_by(IncidentGroup) %>% 
    dplyr::summarise(
        count_incident=n(),
        sum_all_cost = sum(`Notional Cost (£)`, na.rm = TRUE), 
        average_all_cost = sum_all_cost/count_incident)

```

## 2. The distribution of response times

```{r Plot First Attandance Time}
ggplot(fire_data, aes(x=FirstPumpArriving_AttendanceTime)) + 
    geom_histogram(binwidth=5) + 
    xlim(0, 1200) +
    labs(x="Response time (s)", 
         y="Frequency", 
         subtitle="Figure 1: Response Time for First Fire Engine to Arrive from Fire Station")

#ggsave("figure1.png")

#Response times of all incidents

```

```{r Plot Dist by Groups}
type_time <- fire_data %>% group_by("IncidentGroup")%>%  summarise(type_mean=mean(FirstPumpArriving_AttendanceTime))

ggplot(fire_data, aes(x=FirstPumpArriving_AttendanceTime, fill=IncidentGroup, alpha=0.5)) + 
    geom_histogram(binwidth=5) + 
    facet_grid(IncidentGroup~.)+ 
    geom_vline(data=type_time, aes(xintercept=type_mean), linetype=2, colour='black', size=0.4) + 
    xlim(0,1000) + 
    labs(x="Response time (s)", 
         y="Frequency",
         subtitle="Figure 2: Response Time for First Fire Engine to Arrive from Fire Station Group by Incident Type")

#ggsave("figure2.png")

#Figure 2 shows the response times of the three different types of incident (“Fire”, “False Alarm” and “Special Service”) where there was indeed a response.

#For the easier comparison of the distribution of data.

#All group's outliers are within the same range which is about > 900.

#I will be working with outliers in the next chunk to increase the accuracy in further calculations with First Pimp Response time.

```

```{r Omit Outliers}
#Omit Outliers
fire_data <- filter(fire_data, FirstPumpArriving_AttendanceTime < 900)
```

## 3. Summary of Special Service Response Times

Summary of counts and mean of each type of incident and 10th and 90th percentile of response times for each types of incident in 'Special Service' Incident Group.
```{r Special Service}
special_type <- fire_data %>% filter(IncidentGroup == 'Special Service') %>% group_by(SpecialServiceType) %>% drop_na() %>% dplyr::summarise(count=n(), tenth_percentiles=quantile(FirstPumpArriving_AttendanceTime, probs = 0.1, na.rm=TRUE), mean_response_time=mean(FirstPumpArriving_AttendanceTime, na.rm=TRUE), ninetieth_percentiles=quantile(FirstPumpArriving_AttendanceTime, probs = 0.9, na.rm=TRUE))

```

## 4. A t-test comparing Ealing and Greenwich

New dataframe that contains only Ealing and Greenwich for use in our test
```{r t-test}
#Create new sub dataframe
eg_fire <- fire_data[fire_data$IncGeo_BoroughName %in% c('EALING', 'GREENWICH'),]

#Summary of all records that is Ealing and Greenwich
eg_fire_summary <- eg_fire %>% group_by(IncGeo_BoroughName) %>% dplyr::summarise(count=n() , mean_time=mean(FirstPumpArriving_AttendanceTime, na.rm=TRUE), sd_time=sd(FirstPumpArriving_AttendanceTime, na.rm=TRUE))

eg_fire_summary

#Since the outliers are already dealt with in the entire data set, there are no outstanding outliers for incident cases in Ealing and Greenwich. The data is ready for examine and test.
```

```{r }
#The distribution of the response time for incidents at Ealing and Greenwich station. We are interested in whether the two means values are equal.

ggplot(eg_fire, aes(FirstPumpArriving_AttendanceTime,..density.., fill=IncGeo_BoroughName)) + geom_histogram(binwidth=10, position="identity", alpha=0.5) + geom_vline(data=eg_fire_summary, aes(xintercept=mean_time), linetype=2, size=0.4) + labs(x="Response Time (s)", y="Density", fill="Borough Name", subtitle="Figure 3: Ealing and Greenwich Incident Response Time Distribution Comparison")

#ggsave("figure5.png")

#Similar mean value, but not clear.

```

```{r}
#2-sample t-test

t.test(FirstPumpArriving_AttendanceTime~IncGeo_BoroughName, eg_fire)

#t(19184)=2.7436, p-value < 0.006

```

Estimation Approach

```{r}
#Estimation

time_es <- lm(FirstPumpArriving_AttendanceTime~IncGeo_BoroughName, data=eg_fire)
(  time_es_emm <- emmeans(time_es, ~IncGeo_BoroughName)  )
(  time_es_contrast <- confint(pairs(time_es_emm))  )

#the mean in response time in Ealing is 313 seconds 95% CI [311--315]. The mean response time in Greenwich is 308 seconds 95% CI [305--311]. The difference in response time is 4.97 seconds 95% CI [1.41--8.53] higher at Ealing compared to Greenwich.
```

```{r}
grid.arrange(
	em <- ggplot(summary(time_es_emm), aes(x=IncGeo_BoroughName, y=emmean, ymin=lower.CL, ymax=upper.CL)) + 
	    geom_point() + 
	    geom_linerange() + 
	    labs(y="Response Time (s)", x="Incident Borough Name", subtitle="Error bars are 95% CIs", title="The Response Time (s)"), 
	
	cont <- ggplot(time_es_contrast, aes(x=contrast, y=estimate, ymin=lower.CL, ymax=upper.CL)) + 
		geom_point() + 
	    geom_linerange() + 
		labs(y="Difference in Response Time (s)", x="Contrast", subtitle="Error bars are 95% CIs", title="Difference in Response Time (s)") +
		geom_hline(yintercept=0, lty=2),
	ncol=2
)

# Section 2

This report illustrates the analyses of associated costs and responding time to fire incidents. The purpose of this is to present insights requested by Fire service managers and local politicians. Data analysed is obtained from the Fire service, containing essential information such as estimated cost of the incident response, the attendance time for the first fire engine to arrive from fire station, the location of the incident, and the type of incidents i.e. Fire, False Alarm, or Special Services. 

There are 322,375 data records. Only 2,111 cost data entries are missing. I decided to omit those entries with missing records of costs, when analysing the estimated costs for the incident response, because it would not have a significant effect on the calculations (Table 1). As a result, data showed that the aggregated costs associated with responding to Fire incidents is £42,569,636, but £60,742,034 for False Alarm incidents. Though the sum of all cost for Fire incident is lower than those of False Alarm incidents, the average incident response cost for Fire incident is the higher at £841.18, while the False Alarm response cost is £378.34. This is because there are more than doubled counts of False Alarm incidents than Fire.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
summary_cost %>%
  kbl(caption = "Table 1. Summary of Estimated Costs for Incident Response") %>%
  kable_styling()
```

Regarding response times, records of incidents where there was indeed a response are plotted in Figure 1 below. However, for more insights of each incident groups distribution that make up the whole response time distribution, Figure 2 is plotted. All the Three groups have a similar distribution of response time with a slight positive-skewed. This indicates that most incidents have a relatively quicker response times. We can, also, observe that the mode and mean values for all the three separated incidents are at similar range of response time, which is around 250 to 275 seconds. Though, Special Service seems to have an unusual cluster in response time 0 to around 30 seconds.

!["fig1"](figure1.png)
!["fig2"](figure2.png)

Moreover, from these two plots we can clearly see that there are outliers or odd records in all three incident group's response time. All group's odd events are within the same time range which is about 800 seconds or greater. Therefore, records with these odd events are dropped to ensure the highest level of accuracy is obtained in further calculations with response time data.

After examining the summary statistics for the response time for Special Service incidents (Table 2), it could be concluded that most of the Special Service Incidents have similar average response time values. In addition, the response time for the low 10% of incidents in each groups are in a similar range, this also applies for the high 90% of incident groups. However, there is one noticeable group, the Medical Incident, where the average response time is relatively lower than other groups at 193.1 seconds. Similarly, the response time for the low 10% of the whole Medical Incident is extremely fast at 40.0 seconds compared to other types at around 160 to 180 seconds.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
special_type %>%
  kbl(caption = "Table 2. Summary of Special Service Incidents Response Time") %>%
  kable_styling()
```
In this part, I will explore the response time in the area of Ealing and Greenwich. t-test was utilised to test whether the average response time for incidents in Ealing and Greenwich is the same or not. Since the outliers for response times are already dealt with, there are no outstanding odd events for incident cases in Ealing and Greenwich that would manipulate the results. Table 3 shows the counts, average response time and show how spread out incidents' response time are from the average response time. 

```{r, echo=FALSE}
eg_fire_summary %>%
  kbl(caption = "Table 3. Summary of Incidents Response Time in Ealing and Greenwich") %>%
  kable_styling()
```

According to Figure 3, there are some overlaps between the two distribution. However, it is not clear whether the two means are really equal in all situations. We need to do the test to have a clearer picture.

!["fig3"](figure5.png)

Welch Two Sample t-test assessed whether the difference between the two means are equals to zero or not. This type of test is utilised because the two groups i.e. incidents in Ealing and incident in Greenwich is independent of each other.

The test evident at $t(19184)=2.7436$, $p-value < 0.006$ that the mean in response time for Ealing is 313.01 seconds, while the mean in response time for Greenwich is 308.04 seconds. This suggests that the difference between the two area's mean response time is significantly different from zero. 

The t-test result was assessed with caution because, as stated prior, the incidents response time are skewed. The non-symmetrical nature of the data may create biases in our test result. To enhance the understanding and the comparison of the mean response time in these two areas, Estimation approach was utilised.

Results from the estimation approach demonstrated that the mean in response time in Ealing is 313 seconds with 95% confidence interval (311 to 315 seconds). The mean response time in Greenwich is 308 seconds 95% confidence interval (305 to 311 seconds). The difference in response time is 4.97 seconds with 95% confidence interval (1.41 to 8.53 seconds) higher at Ealing compared to Greenwich. Hence, with supporting evidence from the estimation approach, we may conclude with higher accuracy level that Ealing and Greenwich have different average incident response time. The visualised summary is shown in Figure 4 below (based on suggested layout by Cumming (2014)).
